description: Shortly after volunteering to mentor at an Into Games event, I had found an opportunity to help students solve any problems with programming in a Gamejam using Twine, which is a tool I’ve not used before!

Helping students out who are new to games development is something I love doing.

I previously [helped out some college students with designing and prototyping a game](/blog/guiding-students-through-designing-prototying-a-game/) and I enjoyed it so much that I decided to put myself forward to help some more students out a week or two later!

What I was doing was helping a class of college students out with their own Gamejams, where they used **Twine** to make a game based around student loans.
My job was to help the students **find resources**, **manage their workload**, **give feedback**, and **help solve any problems they had with programming**!

**Event:** SideFest Twine GameJam  
**Date of event:** July 2021

### Twine

The first thing I learned about is **Twine**.  
Twine is a free and open-source tool for making interactive fiction in the form of web pages.

**I’ve never used Twine before**, but as I had to help students out with issues they had, I had to make sure I knew Twine well enough to help out and be able to find good resources.

I spent some time looking over Twine videos and playing around to get to understand it, and then looked into the documentation. It was well documented, so that was a good resource for me to use.

There wasn’t much time between me applying to do this, and the gamejam starting, so I was **learning along the way from helping out the students!** And I learnt a lot!

### Preparing a PowerPoint for teaching

As well as helping out with problems the students had with Twine, I was tasked to make a PowerPoint to **guide** the students through **how to upload their game to Itch.io**.

This was the PowerPoint I made:

I wasn’t going to be the one presenting the PowerPoint, so I had to make sure it was made with **enough information** for someone to present it.

My aim for this PowerPoint was to make it **bright** and **fun** with colours and pictures, but also have enough information on it for them to learn, but I didn’t want *too* much information that there was just lots of reading to do!

When I was making this PowerPoint, I tried to imagine that I was someone who didn’t know anything about Itch.io, so I included a summary of what Itch.io was, along with some important information about it, how to make an account, and finally how to publish their game, as this is what I would imagine would be important to know!

### How to help

![Feedback Image](https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=9594E849DC7FC39E%2161062&authkey=%21AEYaepYp_dTkKJs&width=1600&height=645)

As this gamejam all ran online on a Discord server, the help I was offering was all text-based, and this would either be by **chatting** to the students or giving them all their feedback on a **board** for them to read through.  
Here's an example of one of the boards:

![Board Image](https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=9594E849DC7FC39E%2161061&authkey=%21ANTQK0hsemotUGo&width=1600&height=645)

The students would send me their games, and I would play them and give them feedback, as well as this, they would send me their code, and I would give general code feedback, and help them understand good code practices, along with this, I provided multiple resources for the students to refer to, so instead of just telling them the good code practices, I was able to provide examples.

I really enjoyed doing this! And by the end of the week, there were some really clever, and creative games which were produced!

### Conclusion

Through helping out with this Gamejam, it’s helped me realize that mentoring is **really fun**!  
It’s definitely something which I would like to do **more** of in the future.

And as I’ve written this blog a few months after I had done this, I’ve taken part in a few more mentoring activities, which I’ve written about in these blogs below:

[Guiding Students Through Designing & Prototyping a Game](/blog/guiding-students-through-designing-prototying-a-game/) - Nov 17, 2021  
Back in July, I volunteered at Into Games to help a group of students with project management for designing and prototyping a mining game loop. This was my first ever mentoring experience.

[Being a Guest Speaker At a Highschool](/blog/i-gave-a-talk-in-person-for-the-first-time) - Dec 14, 2021  
I delivered a talk to students in my old high school, this was my first time talking in front of a large audience in person, as up to this point, a lot of the stuff I had done was online due to covid!
